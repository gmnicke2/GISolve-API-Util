Goal:
  Create an example of using CyberGIS OpenService API that visibly and smoothly demonstrates
  how various API functions (Security/Integration/Computation) and REST calls work, combine, and rely on each other.
  
Plan:
  Written in Python
  Uses requests library instead of pycURL
  Imported libraries : 
    os (for environmental variables), sys(for stderr writing), json (for requests/responses), argparse, requests (for REST calls), getpass (if user wants to specify a password)
  4 Main Files (cg_token/app/job/version.py) :
    executed with either command line arguments to fill [API URL, App Name, Job Name, Job ID, 
    	Client ID, Client IP, Username, Password], as well as additional arguments depending on action
        OR TAKEN IN FROM BASH ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
    All arguments drawn from bash env variables unless otherwise supplied
	EXCEPT for debug & dest/config/jobconfig files
    Missing arguments cause help to be printed and exit
    Only print debug info/response data/etc. upon -d/--debug request
    Add terminating '/' to URL if non-existent
  Demonstrate the use and integration of: 
    token issuing & revoking, 
    app registering/configuring,
    retrieving app info/config,
    launching/monitoring a job,
    retrieving job output
