Goal:
  Create an example of using CyberGIS OpenService API that visibly and smoothly demonstrates
  how various API functions (Security/Integration/Computation) and REST calls work, combine, and rely on each other.
  
Plan:
  Written in Python
  Uses requests library instead of pycURL
  Imported libraries : 
    os (for environmental variables), json (for requests/responses), argparse, requests (for REST calls)
  3 Main Files (gisolve_token.py, gisolve_app.py, gisolve_job.py) :
    executed with command line arguments to fill [API URL, App Name, Client ID, Client IP, Username, (Optional) Password], as well as additional arguments depending on file
    Password drawn from permanent os info if not supplied
    Missing arguments cause help to be printed and exit
    Only print debug info/response data/etc. upon -v/--verbose request (maybe -d/--debug)
    Add terminating '/' to URL if non-existent
  Demonstrate the use and integration of: 
    token issuing & revoking, 
    app registering/configuring,
    retrieving app info/config,
    launching/monitoring a job,
    retrieving job output
